# 🍎 macOS-Inspired Developer Portfolio

A macOS-style portfolio website that showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a **Full-Stack Developer**, designed to feel like a real desktop environment while remaining fast, responsive, and accessible.

## ✨ Overview

This project is a personal portfolio built with a **macOS desktop UI concept**.
Instead of a traditional scrolling website, it mimics familiar macOS interactions such as windows, dock navigation, and smooth transitions — while still behaving like a modern web app.

The goal is to:

- Stand out visually among typical portfolios
- Demonstrate strong frontend architecture
- Show practical full-stack thinking and code quality

---

## 🧠 Design Decisions

- **macOS UI** was chosen to differentiate from generic portfolio designs
- **Vite + React** for fast builds and modern DX
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent styling and rapid iteration
- **TypeScript** for maintainability and scalability
- Desktop-first UX with graceful mobile adaptation

---

## 📱 Mobile Experience

While inspired by macOS, the portfolio adapts cleanly to mobile devices by:

- Simplifying window interactions
- Replacing hover-based UI with tap-friendly controls
- Preserving content clarity over visual effects

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add window drag & resize behavior
- Keyboard shortcuts (⌘ + K style navigation)
- Blog section powered by MDX
- Light performance optimizations
- Accessibility enhancements (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
